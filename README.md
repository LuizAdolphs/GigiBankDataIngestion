# GigiBankDataIngestion

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ju0x24jb3mtmctwv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/LuizAdolphs/gigibankdataingestion)

To run this project, open and run in Visual Studio 2019 (unfortunately looks like FileWatcher doesn't work in unix systems in the standalone published version... So in order to run in unix you need to run using dotnet cli commands like run or debug)
